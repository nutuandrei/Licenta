London attack: Met defends dropping inquiry into attacker
The Metropolitan Police have defended a decision to downgrade an inquiry into one of the men who carried out Saturday night's terror attack.They said Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, of Barking, London, was known to police and MI5 in 2015, but there had been no evidence of a plot.The two other perpetrators were not known to security services.
All 12 people arrested on Sunday after the London attack have now been released without charge.On Tuesday, counter-terror officers were searching a property in Ilford, east London, after entering the address at around 01:30 BST. No arrests had been made, police said.Butt and his two accomplices drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market in an attack which began at 21:58 BST.All three men were shot dead by police within eight minutes of receiving a 999 call.Seven people were killed and 48 injured. NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition.Butt had featured in a Chanel 4 documentary The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year.Another of the attackers has been named by police as Rachid Radouane, 30, from Barking. He was a chef who also used the name Rachid Elkhdar and police said he claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan.London attack: What we know so farWhat did police know about Khuram Butt?
Butt featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year about Islamist extremists with links to the jailed preacher Anjem Choudary. The married father-of-two, who worked for London Underground as a trainee customer services assistant for nearly six months last year, could be seen in the programme arguing with police officers in the street, after displaying a flag used by so-called Islamic State in a London park.Two people in Barking, east London, had also raised concerns about Butt, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said.One man called the anti-terrorism hotline in 2015, and a woman went to the local police because she was scared Butt was trying to radicalise her children.Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into Butt began in 2015, but "there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly". The inquiry was "prioritised in the lower echelons of our investigative work", Mr Rowley added. Asked if that had been a poor decision, Mr Rowley said he had seen nothing yet to suggest it, according to the BBC's home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw.At any one time there are around 500 active counter-terrorism investigations concerning 3,000 people of interest.Mr Rowley said work was continuing to understand more about the attackers, "their connections and whether they were assisted or supported by anyone else".Analysis: Khuram Butt showed his extremist coloursBy Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent
It's still not clear when Khuram Butt got involved in radical Islamist politics, but there is ample evidence that he was involved in the al-Muhajiroun network - certainly in 2015 and potentially at least two years earlier still.The main evidence comes from his appearance in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year.The film was a close encounter with part of the ALM network and one of its subjects was Siddhartha Dhar, one of Anjem Choudary's right-hand men.Dhar later skipped bail for Syria. Once there, he appeared in a black mask in an IS execution video.Butt's links may go back further still. Mohammed Shafiq of the Manchester-based Ramadhan Foundation, an anti-extremism group, says that he believes he was verbally assaulted by Butt in 2013 - the day after another ALM follower killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London.Read more from DominicWho were the victims?
James McMullan's family believe he was among those killed. Chrissy Archibald (right) had come to London to be with her fiance.
Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Her family said she had died in her fiancé's arms after being struck by the attackers' speeding van.The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he was believed to be among those who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene.A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.The Met have set up a casualty bureau on 0800 096 1233 and 020 7158 0197 for people concerned about friends or relatives.More on the victims'You will not win'A vigil was held at Potters Field Park by the River Thames on Monday evening to remember the victims. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan led the short ceremony. Addressing the attackers, he said: "We will defeat you. You will not win."On Tuesday, there will be a minute's silence at 11:00 BST in memory of those who lost their lives and others affected by Saturday night's events.A book of condolences will open on Tuesday at Southwark Council's headquarters in Tooley Street.Prime Minister Theresa May, who has already signed it, said in her message that British values are "superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate".
In the days since the attack, Labour has been targeting cuts to the Home Office's policing budget, accusing Theresa May of "letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe".Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Khan warned it could be harder to "foil future terrorist attacks" if the Conservatives cut police budgets in London."The Conservative plans mean another £400m of cuts to the Met," he said. "I'm simply not willing to stand by and let this happen."Foreign secretary Boris Johnson insisted police numbers "remained high" and that the security services did an "incredible job at keeping people safe".Mr Johnson told BBC Breakfast: "All that argument detracts from the responsibility of those scumbags and what they have done."

The Metropolitan Police say that family liaison officers have been deployed to support the family of a person believed to be missing. No details have been given.Meanwhile, they add, officers are working with families of the victims and the coroner to identify those who were killed in Saturday's attack.None of the seven victims have been officially named by British authorities.But there has been confirmation that Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, is one of the victims.The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he is also believed to be among those who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene.
Khuram Butt (L) and Rachid Redouane have been named as two of the three attackersDetails are emerging about the identities of the two men named as being Saturday's attackers.Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, east London, who was known to police, had previously worked for London Underground, Transport for London said.The other was Rachid Redouane, 30, from Barking, who police said claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. Redouane, who was a chef, also used the name Rachid Elkhdar. He was not known to police.  He had also lived for a time in Dublin, Ireland's RTE reports.Redouane married a British woman in Ireland in 2011 before moving back to the UK, it added.

The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, has called for greater investment in the police and security services following the recent attacks in London and Manchester.Facing a BBC Question Time audience, Mr Farron said: "The additional £300m ($387m) that the Liberal Democrats would put into policing across the country would make us safer. The cuts Theresa May's made over the last seven years as home secretary, then prime minister, have not made us safer."But he questioned the need for the intelligence agencies to have greater surveillance powers and warned against "giving up our freedoms and our liberties" saying that was what the terrorists wanted.

Scotland's first minister has warned against "knee-jerk" responses to the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London that could undermine people's freedoms and liberties.Facing a BBC Question Time audience, Nicola Sturgeon condemned the attacks as "horrific and cowardly"  and said that extremism had to be challenged and "rooted out" wherever it was found.But she said the Muslim community must not be used as a "scapegoat" and there needed to be continued investment in the police and security services.Ms Sturgeon did not automatically back increased powers for the police and intelligence agencies saying any new proposals should be looked at carefully and people needed to move forward with "consensus".
A former chief superintendent of the Metropolitan Police says there are "lessons to be learned" in how authorities deal with information they receive from the community.Officials had been alerted about one of the men involved in Saturday's attack in London, as well as about the Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi.There’ll be some lessons to be learned in how we deal with that information. But we have to look at the information. I have some sympathy with the police in terms of information (that) comes in and they have to grade it. They can’t have the same response to every single person, every bit of information.

The London mayor says the police have already had to put up with "big" cuts
Labour mayor of London Sadiq Khan has warned that future cuts to the Met Police are "unsustainable" and could make it harder to foil terror attacks.He said if the Tories win the election the Met faced having to make savings of £400m, on top of £600m since 2010, and up to 12,800 officers could be at risk."Fewer police officers mean we are in more danger," he told the BBC.But Tory predecessor Boris Johnson said London police numbers "remained high" and counter-terror budgets were up 30%. The foreign secretary told the BBC that it was "a bit rich" that Labour were attacking the Conservatives over policing and counter-terrorism, given that its leader Jeremy Corbyn had treated his opposition to anti-terror legislation over 30 years as a "badge of honour".
The Tories say armed police numbers are increasing, after falls since 2010, and officers had extra powers to deal with terrorists.Met Commissioner Cressida Dick has said a debate is needed on future resources in the wake of the London Bridge and Westminster attacks although a former terrorism law watchdog said linking the cuts to terror attacks was a "completely misleading argument".The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said he expected there to be a remorseless focus on the issue of security in the final 48 hours of the election campaign before Thursday's poll despite attempts by the Conservatives to focus on Brexit.Labour has accused Theresa May of "letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe" by allowing total police officer numbers to fall by nearly 19,000 while she was home secretary.'Deeply concerned'Mr Khan said the Met, for which he has direct responsibility, was a "brilliant force" but had already had to swallow "big" budget cuts since 2010 and he was now "deeply concerned" about the effect that a further spending squeeze could have on policing in the capital. The Labour politician said, under current Conservative plans, the Met faced having to make savings of £400m in the next few years. If all of these savings came from reduced police numbers, he said the force faced a reduction in manning of between 10% and 40% - equivalent to losing between 3,400 and 12,800 police constables.
He also warned the Met could lose between £184m and £700m in further funding a year due to changes to the national police funding formula. He told BBC Breakfast that thousands of community police officers, the "eyes and ears" of the force, were now under threat. "It is not sustainable," he said. "One of the first things that I did as mayor of London was to approve a further 600 armed officers as I recognise that having a significant number of armed officers is one of the ways of preventing terrorists causing further harm to our city."Asked whether he believed that London would be less safe if the Conservatives were re-elected, he replied: "Under a renewed Theresa May government, we would have fewer police officers... there is no doubt that fewer police officers mean we are in more danger."The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2016, police workforce numbers in England and Wales fell by 18,991, or 13%.
Mr Johnson said he agreed the Met should be "robustly financed" and that while he was mayor he had reached an "invaluable" agreement with the then home secretary Theresa May to maintain overall police numbers in the capital at about 32,000, which he said had contributed to falling crime levels."The number of police officers in the capital city has remained high," he told BBC Radio 4's Today."It is up to the mayor of London, if he chooses, to spend more on policing and to keep numbers high. What we did was reorganise the police in London so as to put more officers on the front line."He insisted the Conservatives were protecting overall police budgets and hiring a further 1,900 security service officers, suggesting that Labour's focus on "so-called cuts" was distracting attention from the motives of the London Bridge attackers. "When you look at what the police did on Saturday night, not only getting to the scene so quickly but dispatching those scumbags within eight minutes, most people would pay tribute to the work of armed officers."Following the London attack, Mrs May said "things need to change" in the fight against terrorism, calling for more to be done about online extremism and for a review into whether security services needed extra powers.And Lord Carlile, the former official reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the BBC that cuts in community policing were "nothing to do with terrorism", saying "nobody in the security services is complaining about their funding".

London attacker: Khuram Butt showed his extremist colours
Khuram Butt wore an Arsenal shirt during his murderous assault on other Londoners.Some of those whom he wanted to kill may too have been wearing the club's colours. But his real colours were the same as many other major terror suspects of the last few years.He was a follower of the banned al-Muhajiroun network, led by the now-jailed preacher Anjem Choudary.
How people in London fought back
Butt was 27 years old, born in April 1990 in Pakistan. He was a British citizen and had lived in east London for a number of years. He was married with two children.
His online CV describes him as having an NVQ Level 2 in business administration and he went on to work in 2012 for a company that manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets.Transport for London has confirmed he worked for almost six months in 2016 as a trainee customer services assistant, leaving in October. He was also once the sole director of a now-dissolved company called Kool Kosmetics.
Mourners have been laying tributes to the victims near London Bridge
It's still not clear when he got involved in radical Islamist politics, but there is ample evidence that he was involved in the al-Muhajiroun network - certainly in 2015 and potentially at least two years earlier still. The main evidence comes from his appearance in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. The film was a close encounter with part of the ALM network and one of its subjects was Siddhartha Dhar, one of Anjem Choudary's right-hand men. Dhar later skipped bail for Syria. Once there, he appeared in a black mask in an IS execution video. In the documentary, Butt appears in one of the key scenes with others from the group angrily arguing with a police officer who said there had been a call that the men had displayed an "ISIS-looking flag" in one of London's parks.'Called me a traitor'Another key figure in the film is Abu Haleema, who has been subject to intensive monitoring by the security services after they discovered his close contacts with a teenager - later to become the youngest child in Britain to be convicted of a terrorism offence. Butt's links may go back further still. Mohammed Shafiq of the Manchester-based Ramadhan Foundation, an anti-extremism group, says that he believes he was verbally assaulted by Butt in 2013 - the day after another ALM follower killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London. "Khuram Butt called me a 'Murtad', which means traitor in Arabic, and accused me of being a government stooge when I confronted Anjem Choudary about him supporting terrorism," he says."The police turned up and Anjem, Khuram Butt and two other men were escorted away. I am not surprised that Khuram Butt carried out the terrorist attack and there are serious questions for the authorities."
In Barking, east London, one resident, Erica Gasparri, told the BBC she had her own concerns that Butt and three other men had been attempting to radicalise her children. She told our team that she went to Barking police station about a year to a year-and-a-half ago with photos of the men and explained her concerns.Another man - who did not want to be identified - told the BBC that Butt had expressed his disgust at the scantily clad way some women were dressed during his time at Transport for London. That man was so worried by his extreme views - including apparent support for an American online advocate for the Syrian jihad - that he called the anti-terror hotline. Butt also appears to have taken part in a confrontational ALM network campaign in 2015 to intimidate Muslims into not voting, on the basis that it was forbidden by God. When he interrupted an Imam at the local Jabir Bin Zayid Mosque after the subject of voting was raised, he was asked to leave. Under investigationSo did the police or MI5 miss something? According to Scotland Yard, he became known to both in the summer of 2015 - but there was no intelligence that he was then plotting.An investigation was opened into his behaviour after concerns had reached counter-terrorism officers. He became one of the 500 active investigations on the go at any one time.  After that file was opened, there was a call from a member of the public about Butt's radicalisation - but it didn't lead to any intelligence that there was definitely something going on. It's not clear when that call came in - and what other cases were pressing - but ultimately Butt was not considered a priority and he was placed in the lower echelons of the long list of individuals under investigation. Critically, that meant Butt would attract less investigatory resources. The question is whether there was, at the time, anything in his covert communications that might have led to a different decision, had it been known.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan led a minute's silence during a vigil for those killed in Saturday's terror attack.
Outside City Hall, people laid tributes to those who died when three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and launched a knife attack in Borough Market.
Five London hospitals are continuing to treat 36 of the victims; 18 are said to be in a critical condition.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who visited the scene with Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick on Monday, described the attack as "cowardly and evil". Speaking from London Bridge he said he was "angry" the three knifemen were seeking to justify their actions using the faith he belonged to.
The overriding message to Londoners has been to carry on as normal.

Newspaper headlines: 'How did London attacker slip through?'
The Daily Star echoes questions about the authorities' knowledge of Butt, but also features a picture from a vigil for victims, held in central London on Monday night.
The Daily Telegraph also leads on who it calls the "ringleader" of London's attack, Khuram Butt, who had been under investigation by the police and MI5 for "six months". The paper says revelations that police concluded Butt was not a threat will only add to "pressure on the authorities over whether enough is being done to tackle extremism".
The Daily Mail features a picture taken from the Channel 4 documentary, showing Butt speaking to a police officer. The paper says there is "growing evidence" that security services "missed a string of opportunities" to stop Saturday's attack on London Bridge and Borough Market.
The Times reports that attacker Butt worked for a man accused of helping to train the 7/7 London bombing ringleader. The paper says Butt had links to preacher Anjem Choudary and one of the four suicide bombers who killed 52 people in 2005 .
The i paper dedicates its front page to two of the named victims - a Canadian, Christine Archibald, and London resident James McMullan, who are believed to be two of seven killed in Saturday's attack.
The Daily Mirror's headline sums up what many are asking on Tuesday, "So how the hell did he slip through?" referring to Khuram Butt, one of the three London Bridge attackers. He is pictured in several papers unfurling a black flag associated with so-called Islamic State, on a Channel 4 documentary screened last year.  He was, says the Daily Telegraph - the brazen jihadist who was free to parade his extremism on TV, and yet the police concluded he was not a threat. "We had him - and let him go" is the headline in the Daily Mail, picking up on what it calls a "shocking admission" from Scotland Yard and MI5. The Times reports that Butt was deemed a "low priority", despite being linked to a key contact of one of the 7 July suicide bombers in 2005.  It believes his extremist links will pile pressure on police and MI5, who are already facing scrutiny over their failure to prevent three atrocities in Britain in 10 weeks.
"Evil in plain sight" is a headline in the Sun.  The paper profiles another of the killers, Rachid Redouane, who it says is believed to have been radicalised during a trip to Morocco where he was born.  According to the Sun, he had split up with his partner, and mother of his baby daughter, in January after she had become sick of his Islamist and homophobic views.The Guardian highlights a warning by the UK's top counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley, that the country will need to radically reform its strategy to stop jihadi attacks because the threat is now at a "completely different" level of danger.  A photograph in the Daily Express shows hundreds of commuters walking over London Bridge on Monday morning as they returned to work following the attack. It was - the paper says - the day London marched on in defiance.The Times describes how one of the victims on Saturday, James McMullan, had been in celebratory mood on the night he died after working for 16 hours a day to create a business that he hoped would revolutionise online education.  The paper says he was an entrepreneur who had gained a £1.2m investment for his business.The 'I' newspaper focuses on what it calls an "inspirational message" from Mr McMullan's family and their vow that "we will not be dragged into hatred".
Met under scrutiny over London attackerThe Metropolitan Police are facing questions over why an inquiry into one of the London attackers was downgraded.  Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, east London, was known to police and MI5 in 2015. But assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said there had been no evidence of a plot before Saturday's killings.The second of the three attackers - all shot dead within eight minutes of police getting a call - has been named as Rachid Redouane, 30, also from Barking. He worked as a chef and was not known to the Met.Meanwhile, the family of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London - who has been missing since Saturday night - say they believe he was among those killed. The first victim named was Canadian Chrissy Archibald.A vigil was held overnight for the seven people killed in the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market, and a minute's silence will take place at 11:00BST. Thirty-six people remain in hospital, 18 in a critical condition.
"So how the hell did he slip through?" asks the Mirror, one of several papers to question how Khuram Butt was able to carry out the London attack, given that he was known to authorities and had been featured in a television documentary about extremism. "Why didn't they stop TV jihadi?" is the Sun's headline, while the Daily Telegraph describes Butt as "brazen".Daily digestPolice and race Officers more respectful to white people than black, suggests US researchBill Cosby trial Actor "used power and fame to prey on women"Zookeeper death Tiger will not be put downTeenage frustration The would-be voters born a day too lateIf you watch one thing today

The Titanic star and Oscar-winning actress has spoken on occasions about how she was bullied at school and called "Blubber"."I was even told that I 'might be lucky with my acting, if I was happy to settle for the fat girl parts'," she said during a speech this year for the WE charity at London's Wembley Arena."I felt that I wasn't enough, I wasn't good enough. I didn't look right... and all because I didn't fit into someone else's idea of 'perfect.' I didn't have the perfect body."The star said her love of acting meant she was always auditioning for roles - however small. "I would often get cast as the crocodile, or the scarecrow, or the dark fairy, I was even a dancing frog once. But it didn't matter. I still loved it... I wanted to be great and I was determined to keep learning."Kate, who made her film debut aged 17 in 1994's Heavenly Creatures, shot to global stardom three years later as Rose in James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic.She said: "The most unlikely candidate, Kate from the sandwich shop in Reading, [was] suddenly acting in one of the biggest movies ever made!"7.

Trump renews feud with London mayor over terror attack
Media captionThis is not the first time the two men have argued in public. Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test when he was first elected
US President Donald Trump has again lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his assurances to Londoners following Saturday's terror attack.He accused Mr Khan of offering a "pathetic excuse" for saying there was no reason for people to be alarmed. Mr Khan had in fact said people should not be alarmed by an increased police presence.After a vigil for the victims of the attack, Mr Khan said he would not allow Mr Trump to "divide our communities". Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in the attack on Saturday.
Mr Trump took issue with Mr Khan's statement in the aftermath of the attack, when the mayor said: "Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed." The US president responded: "At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"He followed this up with another tweet on Monday, saying: "Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"The mayor's spokesman earlier made clear that he was telling Londoners not to be worried about the increased presence of armed police officers in the city.
A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back
Speaking to the BBC after the vigil, Mr Khan said: "We've got to recognise that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fuelling division. "That's not me, that's not the London  I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community."His spokesperson earlier said he "has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context" the mayor's remarks.Calls to withdraw London inviteMr Trump's attacks on Mr Khan have drawn condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic.His critics have accused him of being insensitive and twisting the mayor's words.Politicians in the UK on Monday called on the prime minister to withdraw the invitation for Mr Trump's state visit later this year.
The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: "This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning." Over the weekend, Prime Minister Theresa May refused to criticise Mr Trump, simply saying that Mr Khan was doing a "good job".British voters go to the polls on Thursday in a general election."Try to imagine the UK prime minister attacking the Mayor of NYC the day after 9/11," said European Parliament cabinet member Simon O'Connor.US mayors back KhanNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio was quick to defend Mr Khan, praising him for "doing exactly the right thing"."I don't understand why Donald Trump is trying to undermine a man who's trying to protect the people of London. It makes no sense," Mr de Blasio told the BBC's Nick Bryant during a press conference in New York on Monday. Trump renews feud with mayor of London
Media captionNew York mayor on his London counterpart: "He deserves support, not efforts to undermine him"
The US Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,400 American cities, backed Mr Khan."He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London," the mayors wrote in a statement on Sunday.Mr Khan, a Muslim, has previously criticised the president's plans to temporarily restrict travel to the US from six mainly Muslim countries.After Mr Trump as a presidential candidate announced his plan, Mr Khan told the BBC he hoped he would "lose badly", adding that he was a "buffoon".He also called Mr Trump's views on Islam "ignorant", leading the New York billionaire to challenge him to an IQ test.In the wake of the London attack, Mr Trump has been tweeting about his stalled travel ban.

As an emigrant scouser now living in King’s Landing London, I’ve had to sacrifice a certain quality of life.
One forgone home comfort that may just be a bridge too far, however, is the culinary scene down here. Specifically, I’m talking about the state of the chip shops ('chippy' to me, if not to thee). Where I’m from, we’re accustomed to being able to find traditional fish and chips AND Chinese food all under the same roof. I’m also used to putting curry sauce or gravy on my chips and would imagine most people in a first world country would accept that as standard. Not in London.
It's supposed to be the capital of the world and you can’t even get a Singapore rice, saveloy and curry sauce all in the same gaff. Here are just some of the other regional fish and chip delicacies that tragically haven’t made their way to London yet…

In Arundhati Roy's hotly anticipated new novel Aftab finds a place to belong in the House of Dreams. The reader is Indira VarmaThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness is Arundhati Roy's first novel since her celebrated debut The God of Small Things which won the Booker Prize in 1997. Her hotly anticipated new novel takes us on a mesmerising journey from Old Delhi to Kashmir and back. The lives of a cast of vivid characters are intimately interwoven. Anjum unrolls a threadbare Persian carpet in a city graveyard that she calls home, and where she meets an incorrigible young man who goes by the moniker of Saddam Hussain. Then there is the unforgettable Tilo and the three men who loved her especially, Musa whose fate is heartbreakingly entwined with hers. And also the two Miss Jebeens: the first born in Srinagar and buried, aged four, in its overcrowded Martyrs' Graveyard; the second found at midnight, in a crib of litter, on the concrete pavement of New Delhi. The corrupting nature of power is brought into stark relief as Arundhati Roy's characters endure through the darkest of times and still manage to find hope and most of all love. For more on the acclaimed writer and to download all fifteen episodes visit the Radio 4 website.Indira Varma is well know to television, radio and theatre audiences. She has appeared in a number of television series including, Game of Thrones (as Ellaria Sand), and Paranoid, as DS Nina Suresh. She narrates Radio 4's landmark series, Tommies. Her many theatre appearances include Treatment at the Almeida Theatre, London.Emilio Doorgasingh reads later episodes.
